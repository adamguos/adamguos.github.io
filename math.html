        <p>Hi! I'm Adam Guo, a rising sophomore at Pomona College intending to major in mathematics. I'm particularly interested in the computational applications of math, which ties in to my love of computer hardware and software. I am experienced in programming with Python and Javascript for web/app development as well as data analysis and computation.</p>
<p>This summer, I am working with Claremont Graudate University professor Hrushikesh Mhaskar to accelerate the computation of Gauss quadruature formulas from randomly sampled points of a function. The approach involves using fast Fourier transforms and related divide-and-conquer techniques to represent arbitrary functions in terms of the orthonormal Hermite polynomials. Generalising to very-high dimensions effectively entails solving large systems of equations, which we use the Kaczmarz algorithm to accelerate. All in all, we are able to accelerate the computation from O(n^2) to O(n log n). Through my programming background, I have been assisting Professor Mhaskar and his collaborator Professor Xiaosheng Zhuang (City University of Hong Kong) by implementing the algorithms we are using in Python.</p>
<p>Academically, I took Calculus II and Linear Algebra in freshman year, and will be taking Vector Calculus and Real Analysis next fall.</p>
